  <h2> Hello, I'm Danashia!</h2>
         <p style="font-size:20px;">This is my page for the "My favorite things" project! I'm having a little bit too much fun with this assignment honestly. Giving me this much creative freedom was a mistake. I will now proceed to be completely unhinged (in a professional and academic way, of course). I hope you find some enjoyment going through my page!</p>
  <p>Anyways, this is a page about all the things I'm passionate about! I don't really have an image of myself that I can add but I do have art I've made so you can enjoy that.</p>
